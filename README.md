# Microservices Deployment Project with Kubernetes and Helm

## Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive deployment pipeline for Google's Online Boutique, a cloud-native microservices demo application. The deployment architecture is implemented across three progressive phases, leveraging Kubernetes (Linode LKE), Helm, and Helmfile.

> üõçÔ∏è **Demo Application**: This project deploys [Google's Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), a cloud-native microservices application consisting of 11 services that together form a fully-functional e-commerce platform.
